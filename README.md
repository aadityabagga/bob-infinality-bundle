## Notes

*  At this moment these SlackBuilds are from and for Slackware(R) Linux(R) -current (14.1)
*  The order to build and install is freetype, fontconfig and cairo.
*  There's no need to select a type of font rendering (Windows, Apple or Ubuntu)
   since the "the aim of infinality-bundle is to make use of the vast potential hidden
   in native Linux font rendering back-end". This does not means you can not
   configure some aspects of the font rendering, please check:
   http://bohoomil.cu.cc/#anchor-6 and `/usr/doc/fontconfig-2.10.93/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git`
*  `bob-sources.sh` is an script to mirror the official SlackBuilds, so you do not
   may use it, at least you are trying to test some new official Slackbuilds ;)
*  Check the next screenshots to see the result:
